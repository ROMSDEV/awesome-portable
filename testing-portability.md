add here TestingPortability programs (from TPFC thread, w/ my later addition ideas), info on my typical procedure, things to look for, etc

link to header **_Testing for portability_**

also perhaps remove "Important programs" header in favour of listing those progs here, and can then additionally list programs under suitable main category w/out duplication
