*Work-in-progress*

add here TestingPortability programs (from TPFC thread, w/ my later addition ideas), info on my typical procedure, things to look for, etc

nb - checking program site for stated .net/admin right requirements, system requirements, etc

link to header **_Testing for portability_**

also perhaps remove "Important programs" header in favour of listing those progs here, and can then additionally list programs under suitable main category w/out duplication
- on second thought, uniextract/lessmsi also useful outside testing portability, so maybe keep heading

***

start - w/ my typical procedure

then state other methods/programs people use

eg, virtualbox - quote john t haller from tpfc thread

***

other - 
add snapfiles, softpedia portable, etc to more sites
maybe add note of their (mis)understanding of portability 
on second thought, that might be grounds to exclude them ...
